# Rust Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Rust Learning Repository**! ðŸš€

This repository serves as a collection of my journey in learning Rust. Here, I document concepts, examples, projects, and notes that have helped me gain proficiency in this powerful programming language. The content is organized in a way that is easy to follow and serves as a reference for both myself and others.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, performance, and concurrency. With its modern features like ownership, borrowing, and a strong type system, Rust has become a favorite for building high-performance and reliable software. This repository is my effort to learn and master Rust while building practical and interesting projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into the following directories:

- **`basics/`**: Covers fundamental Rust concepts like variables, data types, ownership, and borrowing.
- **`advanced/`**: Topics such as lifetimes, traits, macros, and unsafe Rust.
- **`projects/`**: Hands-on projects to apply Rust knowledge.
- **`notes/`**: Markdown files with summaries of Rust concepts and best practices.
- **`examples/`**: Small code snippets demonstrating specific features or patterns.
- **`crates/`**: Exploration of popular Rust crates and how to use them.
